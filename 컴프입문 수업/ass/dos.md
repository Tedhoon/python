Write a program reading two integers, each of which is written in a line of the standard
input, and print the difference of the squares of them. For instance, assume that the
integers read are n1 = 2 and n2 = −5, then the difference of squares is 21 since the
squares of n1 and n2 are 4 and 25, respectively.
Each integer is given in a single line of the standard input. Assume that each integer
n is in the range of [−2^31, 2^31 − 1] inclusive (−2^31 ≤ n ≤ 2^31 − 1). Your program should print the difference of squares in a single line.
